At a minimum I want you to incorporate the NFTs from Fidelity.  See if you can find the actual links online and use the images.  If you are unable to find a high-quality image, make a placeholder, but try your best to get an image.  Since I am the owner of the NFTs, if I can do something more with them, tell me.  I want them somehow integrated into the Fidelity drop-down, but they must not overwhelm.  Consider a summary and links to more info.  

A new "more info" section (do NOT call it that) is a great opportunity to advertise my technologist/builder side.  Feel free to incorporate it into the "personal" section.

Very importantly, I really like the look and feel of the existing interactive resume at davidcfacfp.com, so keep the font, colors, etc.  Other than that, feel free to get creative!

Give me three different version along with Cover Letters that naturally flows or scrolls into the resumes.
